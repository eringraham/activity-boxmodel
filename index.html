    <h1>Beauty school: The best haircuts for fine hair</h1>

    <h2>The secrets to giving your fine hair the extra oomph, lift and style you're craving (hint you may want to consider a short crop!)</h2>

    <p>When you have <strong>fine hair</strong>, often you don’t feel very fine at all about it—there’s not much heft to it, it’s difficult to make it hold a style (you've spent hours curling and re-curling limp strands) and giving it some volume seems a feat only pro stylists can achieve. But having the right cut can help immensely (whether that's a graduated bob, blunt layers or a preppy short crop). Greg May, owner of Greg May Hair Architects in Toronto, refers back to his early days as a stylist at Vidal Sassoon, where geometry and architecture were the foundations of training. <em>“You’re looking at three main techniques: keeping it one length, layering (which removes weight) and graduation (building up weight),”</em> he explains. Read on for tips on how to make the most of your fine hair.</p>
    
    <h2>A graduated bob</h2>
    
    <p><em>"This is one of my favourites,"</em> says May. In a graduated bob, the front is either cut horizontally straight or on a downward slope, with the back elevated or lifted. <em>“When the hair is graduated, you are actually building up, or stacking the weight, thus, making it appear fuller,”</em> says May. Think Katie Homes (when her hair was about chin-length).</p>
    
    <h2>A one-length bob</h2>
    
    <p><em>“This cut that never goes out of style,”</em> says May. It not only works well for fine hair (“The hair sits heavier at one length,” says May), but it’s also great as it is very low maintenance. To play it up a bit, add a fringe for interest and more density. When he does layer fine hair, May keeps the layers very long so as to not remove much weight. Style aficionado Anna Wintour hasn’t strayed from this classic cut for years, and the always chic Alexa Chung also keeps her hair in a bob (Chung’s has some slight layers, which add softness).</p>
    
    <h2>A short crop</h2>
    
    <p><em>“Shorter hair is stronger than longer hair so you could try a very short crop such as Charlize Theron's latest super short crop to make your fine tresses appear thicker,”</em> says May. Yes, less hair (in terms of length) to make your fine hair appear like more hair.</p>
    
    <h2>Long hair, layered with blunt ends</h2>
    
    <p>Yes, just because you have fine hair doesn’t mean you have to resign yourself to short cuts. “The trick to fine hair is adding concave layering for movement in the hair and to keep the ends blunt to add fullness,” says Brennen Demelo, owner of Brennen Demelo Studio in Toronto. The idea is that you want to avoid over-texturizing the hair.</p>
